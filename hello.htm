<h1>My First Web Page</h1>

<p>This is my first web page. It's a little basic, but it's helping me understand how HTML works and how to markup my content.</p>

<h2>Exploring Web Design</h2>

<h3>Exploring HTML</h3>

<p>HTML, CSS and JavaScript are just plain text files.</p>
<p>Make sure you are using a Plain Text file, not adding any extensions by default.</p>
<p>It can be saved as .htm or .html, browsers no longer care which.</p>
<p>In the HTML code, the head goes first, containing the title and non-visual functional elements like external CSS and JavaScript.</p>
<p>Close the head, then create the body. This is your web page. Make sure to close the body at the end before closing the HTML code.</p>
<p>Headers are h1, h2 and so on. The body contains paragraphs using p. </p>
<p>This is intuitive. b for bold, i for italics, etc.</p>

<h3>Exploring CSS</h3>

<p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to control the visual presentation of web pages. It goes inside style tags in the head.</p>
<p>CSS is not a markup language, but a presentation language, so syntax is different.</p>
<p>After calling a selector, like body or h1, curly brackets are necessary so the program knows what to style.</p>
<p>Inside the curly brackets go properties and their values.</p>
<p>You can style the color, font, font family, size, etc.</p>
<p>CSS is one of those languages that requires semicolons to make things work.</p>
<p>In CSS, the more specific value is the winner.</p>
<p>Any child style overwrites the parent style.</p>

<h3>Exploring JavaScript</h3>

<p>JavaScript is used to control the behavior of page elements. It is a scripting language based on the ECMAScript standard.</p>
<p>Using JavaScript, you can submit forms, validate information, and animate elements, among other things.</p>
<p>JavaScript should be enclosed in a script tag. This script tag can go in the body if it's for a specific element in the body.</p>
<p>However, best practice is to externalize JavaScript, then bring it in as a resource.</p>
<p>To define a variable in Javascript, var variableName = "value";</p>
<p>Define a function, function variableName() { code to do stuff; }</p>
<p>If you want to use a function, call it by fileName.element.function.means = variable</p>

<h3>Learning to Code</h3>

<p>Best practice is generally to write CSS and JavaScript in separate documents, then reference them into the HTML.</p>
<p>This makes the site simpler and easier to maintain.</p>

<h2>The Field of Web Design</h2>

<p>Web design includes considering UX and UI, a variety of content types, and functionality.</p>
<p>It is important to have a solid understanding of how the web works, who your audience is, and what technologies are necessary in creating websites.</p>
<p>Web Designer: front-end design -visuals, planning and structuring sites, UI design, and client-side interactivity</p>
<p>Front End development requires minimal scripting and little to no programming.</p>

<h3>Different Areas of Web Design</h3>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>If you want to get online quickly use a hosted blog or site with templates.</p>

<h3>Working with a CMS</h3>

<p>CMS's work by storing content in databases that allow the site to call it when needed.</p>
<p>A CMS will work/ edit through any browser. Many include templates as well as independent design space.</p>
<p>They may also include functional elements like blogs, calendars, etc.</p>
<p>CMS's can be restrictive in design and functionality. Some require no coding skills, while others require more extensive coding skills.</p>

<h3>Choosing a Web Host</h3>

<p>Think about needs for the site and how they might grow in the future.</p>
<p>You often get what you pay for.</p>
<p>'Unlimited' hosting space is usually not unlimited. Unless storing videos or music files, you probably won't need that much.</p>
<p>Unless you are in e-commerce, data transfer doesn't matter that much.</p>
<p>Always read the fine print to discover any hidden charges.</p>
<p>Do you need a dedicated server or is a shared server okay? Make sure you are not on a shady server - spam, phishing, etc. Use Axandra's IP lookup</p>
<p>Will all the languages and features of your site be supported? Do you have proper root-level access?</p>
<p>Look for a hosting company that offers a high level of user support.</p>

<h3>Choosing a Domain Name</h3>

<p>Make sure client understands that their company name may not be available. Be flexible, and have a list of alternatives.</p>
<p>Make sure the domain name is MEMORABLE</p>
<p>Make sure YOU own the domain.</p>
<p>Note primary and secondary servers, which are redirected to the domain.</p>

<h3>Administering Sites</h3>

<p>Bluehost is a good hosting service.</p>
<p>cPanel is a server administrative tool used by hosting services for site administration. You don't have to use every tool or service available on it.</p>
<p>Create email account(s) associated with your domain.</p>
<p>File Management is where you upload and post files to your site.</p>
<p>There is also usually a backup tool to automatically backup your site.</p>
<p>File Manager has a root function where you can see EVERYTHING on your site in one listing. There is a lot of functionality here.</p>
<p>Domain management allows you to register new domains, transfer domains, and manage multiple other domains associated with your account.</p>
<p>Redirects are the domains you have that redirect to your default site.</p>
<p>cPanel also has analytics tools to help track your traffic and security features to protect your users when conducting ecommerce.</p>
<p>Use the index of images to protect your intellectual property.</p>
