<h2>Design Aesthetics for the Web</h2>

<h3>What is Aesthetics?</h3>
<p>Aesthetics is an area in philosophy in which beauty is studied as it relates to art.</p>
<p>Taste is to describe beauty by your senses.</p>
<p>Beauty can be subjective and dependent on context.</p>
<p>Beauty arises when qualities are combined in away that pleases the senses and the intellect.</p>
<p>Aesthetics refers to the visual attraction and cohesiveness of a work.</p>
<p>Good design relates moods and feeligs.</p>
<p>Web design should be fluid, to adapt to a variety of devices.</p>
<p>First impressions are vital.</p>
<p>The aesthetics of a design can be the difference between positive and negative brand association.</p>
<p>Visual appeal can be immediate and unconscious.</p>

<h3>Examples from Art and Design</h3>
<p>Nature: galaxies, forests, desterts, animals</p>
<p>Manmade: furniture, architecture</p>
<p>Art: Michelangelo, Bernacelli, Van Gogh, Andy Warhol, Ai Weiwei, Milton Glaser, Michael Bierut, David Carson</p>
<p>Web Design: Jason Sanga Maria, Chris Coyier, Meagan Fisher, Jeffrey Zeldman, Rachel Andrew, Paul Boag, Aaron Gustafson, Rachel Hinman, Cameron Moll, Luke Wroblewski, Dan Cederholm, Andy Clarke, Simon Collison, Elliot Jay Stocks, Sarah Parmenter, Veerle Pieters, Yaron Schoen, Jan Rajtoral</p>
<p>^^^ Web Design movers and shakers ^^^</p>
<p>Know who the audience is and create a visual that will appeal to that group.</p>
<p>Provide a perception of quality and honesty.</p>
<p>As a web designer you, you have a responsibility to your clients to create designs that promote their image, their products, or their services, while also attracting their target audience.</p>

<h2>Using Elements of Design</h2>

<h3>Understanding the Elements of Design</h3>
<p>Use these as guides in aesthetic decision making.</p>
<p>Elements of design: The basic components involved with creating any design, whether it's for print or web.</p>
<p>Principles of Design: The rules of design, which should always be considered even if you end up not using them.</p>
<p>Principles are the rules, and elements are the things that help you follow the rules.</p>
<p>There are 8 elements of design: color (hue), value (tone), texture, shape, form, space (whitespace), line, type</p>

<h3>Using Color to Set the Site's Mood</h3>
<p>Set the right mood and convey a deliberate feel or emotion that supports the information within the design.</p>
<p>Primary Colors: red, blue, yellow</p>
<p>Secondary Colors: violet, green, orange</p>
<p>Tertiary Color - a combination of two tertiary colors</p>
<p>Adding white to a color creates a tint.</p>
<p>Adding black to a color creates a shade.</p>
<p>Color harmonies are combinations of colors which people tend to find aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<p>Monochrome: a single color and all of its iterations from white to black</p>
<p>Complementary Colors: represent a par of colors at opposite ends of the color wheel like red and green.</p>
<p>Split Complementary Colors: Selecting a color, and the two colors adjacent to that color's compliment, like red, yellow-green, and green-blue</p>
<p>Analogous (adjacent) Colors: any two colors that are directly next to each other on the color wheel</p>
<p>Color Triad: any three colors equally spaced on the color wheel, like red, green and blue</p>
<p>Colors can represent and convey emotion.</p>
<p>Think about which colors will best represent the product or service you're designing for and which colors will appeal most to the target audience.</p>
<p>Think about the mood you want to project, and use your color wheel to check for harmony.</p>

<h3>Tweaking Color Value to Add Contrast</h3>
<p>Value refers to the relative lightness or darkness of a color within its composition.</p>
<p>Value can help to convey emotion and meaning as well as adding contrast.</p>
<p>Value is the degree of lightness or darkness in a given color.</p>
<p>A pure color plus gray is a tone.</p>
<p>Pastels: happiness, femininity, babies, spring</p>
<p>Muted Tones: sadness, masuclinity, cooler months, serious affairs, camping</p>
<p>Creating contrast can set focal points or indicate areas of emphasis.</p>
<p>Any light object on a dark background is the first place your attention goes, and becomes the focus of attention. Bigger gets more.</p>
<p>The same thing happens with light objects on dark and bright objects on neutral.</p>
<p>Gradation and shadowing can give the illusion of depth.</p>

<h3>Using Texture to Add Depth</h3>
<p>Flat design is a current trend, but texture can create interest and depth.</p>
<p>Texture: the surface quality of any shape within your web layout</p>
<p>Think of how a texture would look and feel and consider how they are created.</p>
<p>Photograph/ scan textures, create textures using filters and blending modes, 'paint' texture into design, use stock images</p>
<p>Where to get texture online: smashingmagazine.com/tag/textures, textureking.com, lostandtaken.com, texturemate.com, zentextures.com, textures.com</p>
<p>Texture can help emphasize a focal point or be used as a decorative element.</p>
<p>Textures can be combined with shapes, lines, colors, lighting, and typography.</p>
<p>Add a sense of depth, using a reflective surface.</p>
<p>Use textures as backgrounds, also to add depth.</p>
<p>Textures can help create a mood.</p>
<p>Combining textures can delineate different areas on your web page.</p>
<p>Texture can go a long way toward making a site memorable and unique.</p>

<h3>Repeating Shapes to Unify Your Design</h3>
<p>Shape can help set the tone of web graphics.</p>
<p>Repeating shapes within a design can help unify all elements in a single layout.</p>
<p>Shape is any flat area bound by line, our outline, value or color.</p>
<p>Shapes are usually self-contained defined areas which can be positive (occupy space) or negative (like whitespace, the area between positive shapes).</p>
<p>In web design, shapes can be functional elements like buttons and navigation bars.</p>
<p>Shapes can be used to carve space, organize, and define areas.</p>
<p>Shape repetition can create a sense of harmony or unity in your design.</p>

<h3>Structuring Your Layout with Form</h3>
<p>Form is the overall mass of shapes within your design and how they relate to one another.</p>
<p>Consider the group of shapes as a whole.</p>
<p>Everything should look like it's meant to go to gether, with nothing out of place.</p>
<p>Plan and execute designs in black and white before adding color.</p>
<p>Be playful. Incoroporate interactive elements.</p>
<p>Form is a way to create a balanced, harmonious layout.</p>
<p>Be organized. Be innovative. Keep it interesting.</p>

<h3>Using Whitespace to Organize Your Design</h3>
<p>Positive and negative space is created automatically by elements of your design.</p>
<p>Space, or whitespace, refers to the intervals, areas, or measurable distances between all the objects or elements in a design.</p>
<p>It's important to leave some spaces completely blank so that the eye has a place to rest between and around the elements, and the user can distinguish important information.</p>
<p>Use paralax scrolling to keep your user engaged.</p>
<p>Vary the space between pages to keep visitors engaged and interested.</p>
<p>Space should be used deliberately.</p>

<h3>Setting Boundaries with Lines</h3>
<p>Lines can define and enhance shapes within the layout and set boundaries between objects within a page.</p>
<p>Line refers to any actual or implied mark, path, mass, or edge which defines position and/or direction within the design.</p>
<p>Lines can be created using any mark making tool and can be created in nearly any shape or size.</p>
<p>The edge of two shapes forms a line, or the illusion thereof.</p>
<p>Lines can create areas of emphasis when they visually 'point' to a focal area.</p>
<p>Lines can imply movement by their inherent directionality and lead your eye across the page.</p>
<p>Use lines to organize information by defining spaces.</p>
<p>Use lines thoughtfully to communicate a sense of order.</p>

<h3>Communicating With the Right Fonts</h3>
<p>Selecting the right fonts in the right sizes and colors can help improve readability and communicate information more effectively.</p>
<p>Type refers to the fonts you choose for displaying text in your designs and how you actually use them.</p>
<p>Fonts can communicate mood, and fonts from the same typeface along with a contrasting font can keep the design cohesive.</p>
<p>Typefaces are a set of fonts in a given font family.</p>
<p>Parts of fonts: x-height, ascender, descender, stem, tail, serif</p>
<p>Two basic font types: serif and sans-serif</p>
<p>Serifs are the little hooks on letters like in Times New Roman.</p>
<p>Serif fonts can lead the eye from one letter to the next, but they can be difficult for dyslexic people to read and become an accessibility issue.</p>
<p>Sans-Serif are a preferred body font.</p>
<p>The leading (pronounced 'ledding') refers to the space between the baseline of one line of text and the baseline of another. In CSS this is called 'line height'.</p>
<p>By default, line height is usually set to 120% of the font size, but this can be overriden.</p>
<p>Adjusting line height can make a design feel more open.</p>
<p>Use consistent font formatting across all of your site's formatting so it is easy to understand at a glance.</p>

<h2>Incorporating Principles of Design</h2>

<h3>Understanding the Principles of Design</h3>
<p>The Elements of Design are the basic components involved with creating any design whether it's for print or web.</p>
<p>The Principles of design are the rules of design, which should always be considereed even if you end up not using them.</p>
<p>Elements are the things that will help you follow the rules for the best outcome.</p>
<p>10 Principles of design: contrast, emphasis, balance, unity, pattern, movement, rhythm & repetition, proportion, simplicity, and gradation</p>

<h3>Using Contrast to Set Areas of Interest</h3>
</p>Contrast: the juxtaposition of opposing elements by way of using different colors, tones, directions, lines, shapes, etc. to show emphasis</p>
<p>When designing your site, decide in advance the relative importance of each element in your design. Which should be highlighted?</p>
<p>Use large elements by small elements, opposing colors, different tones or values, use horizontal, vertical, diagonal elements, play with lines, work with hard or soft edges, harmonious font pairings.</p>
<p>Using contrast correctly will show visitors where to look and keep them engaged.</p>

<h3>Applying Styles to Show Emphasis</h3>
<p>Emphasis happens when attention is focused on a single area within a design to assist the viewer in understanding visually that this particular area is more important than other areas.</p>
<p>Use size and placement of key elements.</p>
<p>Typographic Hierarchy: the specific way of using fonts to create a sense of flow and emphasis on a page by varying the size, weight, color, and spacing of text.</p>
<p>Make sure you understand how HTML and CSS work together.</p>
<p>HTML marks key areas of text before CSS is applied.</p>
<p>CSS styles can be made for each type of text element. There are styles for every type of text including not only headers and paragraphs, but lists, tables, forms, buttons, icons, and images.</p>
<p>CSS allows you to convey meaning through font, text size, bold/ italics, color, etc.</p>
<p>Visit the Base CSS site.</p>
<p>Pair Serif and Sans-Serif for heading and paragraph.</p>
<p>Use size, case, and color to emphasize text.</p>

<h3>Aligning Objects to Achieve Balance</h3>
<p>Balance occurs in a design when the elements as a whole have a feeling of equality of weight, attention, or attraction.</p>
<p>To achieve balance in design, one must consider the plaement and alignment of every single element in one's layout.</p>
<p>Balance can be created symmetrically or asymmetrically.</p>
<p>Balance should achieve an overall sense of harmony.</p>
<p>Try using the grid system to easily create a balanced layout. The elements will be more easily spaced.</p>
<p>Balance text areas and photographs.</p>
<p>Consider alignment of elements.</p>

<h3>Using Hyperlink Styles to Create Unity</h3>
<p>Unity = 'harmony'</p>
<p>Unity refers to the pleasing arrangement of parts within a composition.</p>
<p>Unity is the relationship between the individual parts and the whole of the design, used creatively to express a particular idea or emotion.</p>
<p>Unity in design presents information in a logical structure and creates a sense of order with engaging visuals.</p>
<p>Consider the unity of fonts, colors, shapes, lines, photos, textures, and other decorative elements.</p>
<p>Consider the appearence and behavior of your links and hyperlinks. Override default link settings using CSS (Link, Visited, Hover, Active).</p>
<p>KISS but don't be timid.</p>

<h3>Applying Background Patterns</h3>
<p>Patter offers a way to keep design organized while providing a sense of harmony through use of repeating elements.</p>
<p>Creating elements that are the same size, shape, or have equal spacing are different ways to create patterns.</p>
<p>Use a grid system for organization.</p>
<p>Patterns can be used as decorative elements, like backgrounds.</p>
<p>When adding patterns to your background, apply the style to the body tag of your page. You can also apply it to the wrapper.</p>
<p>The wrapper is the containing element that holds your desing in place within the center of the layout.</p>
<p>Create patterns by scanning fabrics or materials into your computer or drawing designs in Illustrator or PhotoShop.</p>

<h3>Adding Scrolling and Animation</h3>
<p>Movement in graphic design refers to the suggestion of action or direction. Movement in web design can include actual movement.</p>
<p>Movement can be created by line, texture, and shape.</p>
<p>The default scrolling style is 'scrolling' and travels with the text.</p>
<p>You can also use 'fixed' scrolling, in which the background image styas put and the content scroll on top of it.</p>
<p>'Parallax scrolling' is a type of scrolling in which the background images shift slower than the content in the foreground, creating an illusion of three-dimensional depth.</p>
<p>'Easing' is a jQuery animation effect. jqueryui.com has examples of all kinds of effects and widgets you can use with jQuery.</p>
<p>Make sure you are designing your effects with mobile users in mind. Check out jquerymobile.com</p>
<p>Movement creates a sense of interactivity for the site visitor.</p>

<h3>Using Border Styles to Add Rhythm</h3>
<p>Rhythm & repetition refers to the repetition of an element in a design that creates a visual rhythm.</p>
<p>In design, underlying structure can be paired with free-flowing deisng elements.</p>
<p>Rhythm helps establish visual interest in a design, and can happen naturally when the same shapes and patterns are found throughout your site.</p>
<p>Regular rhythm consists of even intervals flowing together.</p>
<p>Progressive rhythm consists of elements which grow or shrink in some way such as size, position, or color.</p>
<p>Try varying repetition styles to avoid monotony.</p>
<p>Apply border styles to any number of sides on a set of elements in your design using CSS</p>
<p>Border styles also help to create structure and define certain areas, and to anchor headings or subsections within an article.</p>

<h3>Achieving Proportion by Scaling Objects</h3>
<p>Proportion can bring a sense of balance, emphasis, and harmony to a design.</p>
<p>Proportion deals with the visual relationship between two or more things in terms of their size, number, or degree.</p>
<p>Proportion = tiered dominance, creating a sense o hierarchy and order</p>
<p>Tier the size of fonts to help viewers identify the important parts.</p>
<p>Create proportion with size by scaling the size of shapes, tiering buttons and thumbnails by 10 or 20% increments.</p>
<p>Using a lot of space with a little text is a good way to do this, whether that space is a large image or lots of whitespace.</p>
<p>Make the most important thing largest, then scale down.</p>

<h3>Creating Simplicity</h3>
<p>Simplicity deals with the ELIMINATION of any non-essential elements or details to reveal the essence of a form.</p>
<p>More simplistic designs tend to receive higher ratings for attractiveness.</p>
<p>Everything in your layout should be needed, and nothing is extra.</p>
<p>Lead the viewer through the layout, considering whether each design element is essential or non-essential.</p>
<p>Also ask if there is any information or elements that are missing.</p>
<p>Set aside a 'finished' design for a couple days before reviewing and finalizing it with fresh eyes.</p>

<h3>Using Gradation to Create Perspective</h3>
<p>Gradation can add a sense of interest or movement to your design.</p>
<p>Gradation refers to any gradual change in a design that occurs by a series of stages, steps, or degrees.</p>
<p>Gradation can be applied to any element within your site.</p>
<p>Gradation draws the eye in and creates a sense of movement in that a gradual change builds a path the eye can easily follow.</p>

<h2>Web Design Industry and Trends</h2>

<h3>Emphasis: Designing for Hand Gestures</h3>
<p>The average app employs 7-18 different touch gestures in addition to manipulating the device itself such as shaking, moving, and tilting it.</p>
<p>7 Common Gestures: tap, double-tap, press, flick, drag, swipe, spread, pinch</p>
<p>To use gestures effectively, interface elements need to be large enough to use</p>
<p>The actual sizes of interactive elements and the use of whitespace are vital to helping users avoid touch errors.</p>
<p>The target element should be 10 to 12 mm which is roughly 37 to 45 px</p>
<p>There should be at least 8 px space between elements.</p>
<p>Keep the thumb zone in mind. This is the area that one and two handed users are likely to reach comfortably by thumb.</p>
<p>Put the more important elements in the thumb zone, less important in the area under the thumb 'bend zone', most important in the area in front of the thumb.</p>
<p>Least important elements should be in the extending thumb area at the top of the screen.</p>
<p>Use whitespace to maximize touchability of important elements.</p>
<p>Tappable areas should be large enough for the average index finger.</p>
<p>Keep menus short and sweet with easy homepage access.</p>
<p>Make site search visible.</p>
<p>Use mobile-specific features like tap to call and social sharing.</p>
<p>Put labels above forms so they are visible as users input data.</p>
<p>Place calls to action in prominent view.</p>
<p>Try to keep load time short by using CSS elements instead of graphics.</p>
<p>Make sure your sliders are easy to drag.</p>

<h3>Typography: Choosing and Using Web Fonts</h3>
<p>Web-Safe fonts must be cross-platform, already installed on visitor's device. This list is actually rather small.</p>
<p>Web-Safe fonts are specified in CSS as a "font set" so that unavailable fonts have specified fallbacks. {font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif}. The site will use the first available on the list from left to right.</p>
<p>Web Fonts are platform independent, do not need to be installed on visitor's device, and have hundreds of options.</p>
<p>Google fonts require a rule in your CSS and a link in the head to the web fonts source. There is also an option for using the @import rule, or JavaScript instead of the standard link.</p>
<p>Get your online fonts from subscription-based or free websites that host fonts.</p>
<p>Font types: serif and sans-serif, slab serif, cursive, handwriting or script, decorative, and typewriter</p>
<p>Choose fonts that contrast one another, play with scale, match text with tone, go BIG with scripts and slabs, and BE COURAGEOUS.</p>
<p>See speciman on Google's font directory offers suggestions for font pairings.</p>
<p>Try overlapping text, inline fonts, lettercase, and flat shadows.</p>
<p>Remember fonts are there to help convey meaning in a harmonious way.</p>

<h3>Balance: Editing Images for Social Media</h3>
<p>Balance occurs in a design when the elements as a whole have a feeling of equality of weight, attention, or attraction.</p>
<p>To project a unified brand image, a business must have a strong profile pic or avatar, and an equally interesting header or graphic (banner or cover image).</p>
<p>Profile pic should be a centered company logo or mascot. For small businesses, a photo of the business owner is also common practice.</p>
<p>The image should be easily discernable from its maximum size down to 25 px square.</p>
<p>Profile pictures: brand recognition, scalability</p>
<p>Headers: cropping, scaling, orientation, balance</p>
<p>Use the largest of multiple proportion requirements for scalability, keeping important elements centered.</p>
<p>Try to keep file sized under 2 MB</p>
<p>When creating graphics for social media, use content-aware scaling or content-aware fill to expand a background as needed to fill the frame and add marketing copy in areas where it won't be obscured by a profile pic or other overlaid text.</p>

<h3>Form: Moving Beyond Flat Design</h3>
<p>Flat design includes: flat color, flat color w/ shading, minimalism, stripped down icons, and lots of whitespace used with sans-serif and slab serif fonts.</p>
<p>We may be currently moving away from flat desing, but we don't yet know where to.</p>
<p>Good design = project goals + visual appeal to target audeience</p>
<p>Form + function = good</p>
<p>Create texture, gradation, and play with light and shadows.</p>

<h3>Color: Theory and Trends</h3>
<p>Great design uses the colors that are right for the project, regardless of trend.</p>
<p>See what the competition is doing.</p>
<p>Consider the identity/ image of what or whom you are designing for.</p>
<p>Determin the aesthetic preferences of the target audience.</p>
<p>Use your color wheel.</p>
<p>Create a moodboard to determine aesthetic choices.</p>
<p>On the web, RGB colors are more vibrant than how you see them in print.</p>
<p>Look at color throughout history, and the seasons.</p>
<p>Start with one color, then accent with others. Using a key photograph can be a good way to select your palette.</p>
<p>PhotoShop has an invert feature that give you exact opposites on the color wheel.</p>
<p>Try to select one primary, one secondary, and one accent color. Usually you won't need more, but if you do, try using tints, tones, or shades of your primary or secondary color.</p>
<p>Be careful using trends to avoid quickly becoming outdated.</p>

<h3>Movement: Adding Type over Video</h3>
<p>Video provides active, dynamic movement that engages movement and makes webpages sticky.</p>
<p>Video must often be paired with text to convey a specific message or call to action.</p>
<p>Legibility refers to letter forms like differentiating letters that might look like numbers.</p>
<p>Choosing typefaces to pair with video is essential because the text will be competing with the movement behind it.</p>
<p>Using typefaces with bold and black options will help improve readability.</p>
<p>Used CSS styling like letter spacing and line height to make the font size legible.</p>
<p>Play around with CSS features to make sure that text does not blend in witht the video.</p>

<h3>Pattern and Gradation</h3>
<p>Pattern is a way to keep design organized while providing a sense of harmony through use of repeating elements.</p>
<p>Gradation is a gradual change within an element that occurs by a series of stages, steps, or degrees.</p>
<p>CSS repeat tiles graphics, designed to be seamless and can repeat along x or y axis.</p>
<p>Radial gradients can creat a vignette effect that highlights content.</p>
<p>CSS3 gradients have soft, feathery transitions, or hard edges. Use a tool like CSSmatic.com to save time.</p>
<p>SVG code takes an SVG image and allows the file to be specified as the background image of a CSS element. SVG is very crisp on Hi-Rez screens and it is supported by more browsers, including IE9.</p>
<p>Animate a color fade using CSS and JavaScript.</p>
<p>Use a CSS pattern where the browser draws the pattern based on CSS rules applied to an element via a class attribute.</p>
<p>Use CSS to create pattern using a set of linear gradient and background color style rules.</p>
